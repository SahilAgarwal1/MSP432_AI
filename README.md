# MSP32 Language Processing AI
### This project contains the code for a Language Processing Neural Network, created for the MSP432.
### The MSP432 is set up to pick up noise through an external microphone, process the sound through the neural architecture
### and output it's resultant prediction on what was said through UART, as well as on a LED daughter board display.

# Installation Instructions
 ### This repo contains all files necessary for the projected to be imported into TI's Code Composer Studio.
 ### The board support package is included, however the driver libraries for the MSP432 should be installed 
 ### from TI's Website
